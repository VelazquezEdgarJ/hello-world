# hello-world

Hi,

My name is Edgar Velazquez, I just join github and i like to learn programing languajes and follow the new inovations that come out to the public.
A hobby that I have is to find ways to fix things that are broken, i like to work on cars, computers, and other electronics.
Programing is one of the new passion that i found. trying to learn C++, Javascript, Python, and COBOL.
